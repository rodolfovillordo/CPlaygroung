Find a peak in a two dimension matrix (N x M);

An coordinate n,m is a peak if and only if (iff) it's value is greater or equals all 
it's neighbors;

considering the matrix

a b d e
f g h k
l m n o

g is a peak iff g >= f, g >= h g >= b g >= m;

i.e
given the 3x4 matrix M:
    1 2 3 4 
M = 0 9 6 7
    2 3 8 0

9 (M[1][1]) os a peak on M

Greedy ascent algorithm: Get a position in the middle of the matrix define 
a path patter and walk trough elements until find a peak. 
	- Complexity: O(N*M); O(n^2) if N==M.

Divide and conquer algorithm: 
* Get a column (j) in the middle of the matrix and find the global maximum 
	element e(i,j)
* compare e(i, j-1) e(i, j) and e(i, j+1)
* pick the left columns if e(i, j-1) is greater than e(i,j); and similarly to 
	the right.
* recursively solve the new problem with half of the columns;
* if e(i,j) is greater than e(i, j-1) and e(i, j+1); e(i,j) is a peak
* if you have a single column, find the global maximum and it's the peak

Complexity: cols * ln(rows)
